text = """When I was child, I never told my parents: “When I grow up, I want to be a fullstack Ruby on Rails 
    developer.” Nor did I dream of being a Python engineer, a UX designer, a back-end architect or a front-end lead. 
    There is a reason for this. These software jobs did not exist. There was no such thing as the internet, as we know 
    it, nor the spectacular array of jobs like these that it has spawned. This is a matter of regret, considering the 
    benefits of this sort of work. On US job sites last week, salaries of up to $175,000 were being offered to those 
    who know that Python and Ruby are computer programming languages, and UX means user experience, as in the experience 
    of using a website. Equally ample wages were available for those who have become experts in the front-end of a 
    website — what you see when doing online shopping — and the back-end, the bit in the background that makes the site 
    work. There are other benefits. One person can build a self-sustaining business once they master these software 
    skills. They can run it from their laptop by the beach in an agreeable remote-working spot, with other digital 
    nomads. Pleasing as all this is, there is something unsettling about the speed at which the online revolution has 
    bred a new generation of workers doing jobs that underpin so much of modern life — yet utterly baffle outsiders. 
    For a start, what does a parent do when a teenager comes home and asks if it is worth getting into Python 
    engineering? It would be one thing if parents had done such jobs themselves, but the tender age of many tech workers
    makes this unlikely. A global survey of more than 30,000 software developers last year showed 59 per cent had yet to
    turn 30. No wonder research in England this year showed parents of 11 to 18-year-olds feel overwhelmed about giving 
    career advice. Nearly two-thirds of them had a child who had shown an interest in a career that they knew nothing 
    about, according to the Talking Futures careers campaign that commissioned the study. The tech industry’s abysmal 
    use of jargon does not help. It stops job hunters applying for roles that employers struggle to explain, separate UK
    research by the Babble tech company showed last week. Then there is the wider problem of the digitally excluded, 
    people who flounder when they suddenly have to use an app to park their car, or a website to check their bank 
    balance. When my colleague Andrew Hill wrote in February about trying to help elderly relatives deal with demands 
    for online passwords and downloaded documents at banks, insurers and pension providers, he was flooded with 
    sympathetic messages from fellow sufferers. The same thing happened last month when another journalist, Pete 
    Paphides, wrote about his late father getting a parking fine because he was unable to pay electronically. That story
    prompted campaigner Esther Rantzen to tell the BBC that “very often, decisions are made by people in their forties 
    who literally have no understanding that anyone older should feel differently about the decision they’re making”. 
    Even younger, tech-savvy people can be confounded. “I’ve been frustrated on certain mobile apps,” a 35-year-old 
    American named Biron Clark told me last week. He used to be a tech recruiter in New York City but now runs his own 
    job-search advice website, Career Sidekick — from Panama City. He does not think young software developers are 
    necessarily to blame for making apps that vex older users. As he says, their bosses should be making sure online 
    life is easy to navigate for everyone. And having taught himself everything he needed to set up his website, Clark 
    has encouraging words for those who fear the digital revolution is leaving too many people behind. “I feel nothing 
    but positive about it,” he says. “There are just more opportunities every year for those who are paying attention.
    I am sure he’s right, but if everyone taking those opportunities paid more attention to the needs of all users, and 
    used language everyone can understand, the inexorably online world would also be a lot better than it is today."""
